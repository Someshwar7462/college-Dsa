📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice implemented in Java.
I created this repo to strengthen my problem-solving skills and to maintain a structured record of concepts and solutions I practice regularly.

The solutions focus on clarity, correctness, and optimized approaches, with special attention to interview-oriented problems.
